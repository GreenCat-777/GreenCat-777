## About Me
Hi People,
I enjoy jailbreaking devices and doing unintended things, I've made a plethora of Scriptlets for the kindle along with other packages and ports of linux distros. Please understand I cannot code, but I can make SH scripts, (lol) but I can help you with any kindle related questions. You can reach out to me [on discord](https://discord.com/users/902006605791494255), or email me at greencat777456@gmail.com

All my projects are free and open source, if anyone has charged you for them you have been scammed.
